main.py is the first attempt. the second is att2, third att3.

03/13/2025:
att3 is stable, and calculates E[N], E[T] and double checks their value. implemented support for other distributions. will need to spread this out across files to keep it compact, which is the next plan.

04/02/2025: 
Python versions are not being super worked on anymore, rust version is now under src. pending a lot of work though. Priorities -- getting predictions of mean response time and mean queue length working for other distributions. Later, fleshing out scheduling policies and MSJ.
